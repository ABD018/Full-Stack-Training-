<h2>Without clear</h2>
<div class="div1">div1</div>
<div class="div2">div2 - Notice that div2 is after div1 in the HTML code. However, since div1 floats to the left, the text in div2 flows around div1.</div>
<br><br>

<h2>With clear</h2>
<div class="div3">div3</div>
<div class="div4">div4 - Here, clear: left; moves div4 down below the floating div3. The value "left" clears elements floated to the left. You can also clear "right" and "both".</div>
